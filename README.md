# Code Challenge: Bank of Flatiron

## Learning Goals

- Implement a mini web app to practice on components, props, state, events and data fetching in react

## Introduction

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

## Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data

In your project directory, create a db.json file and use this [data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EWN0qLfAWfgzO1N2P8H5WmrsTx0nMkhp3s-rXVESTNA/edit). for your server DB.
Run this command to get the backend started: `**json-server --watch db.json**`
Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:8001/transactions


## Project Guidelines

Your project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

### Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

See a table of all transactions.
* Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table *the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend*
* Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

### Bonus Deliverables

These bonus deliverables are here if you want an extra challenge and won't affect your score. Make sure to commit your work to save your progress before attempting the bonus deliverables!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.

- Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table
